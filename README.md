# SCP: Echoes in the Dark

![Project Logo](assets/imgs/logo.png)

**SCP: Echoes in the Dark** is an augmented reality (AR) app that transforms your space into a spooky SCP field mission. Designed for an elective university class, *Augmented Reality*, this project goes above and beyond expectations, bringing the mysterious SCP universe into the real world.

## Description

This app was inspired by my love for the SCP universe and the challenge of creating something truly unique. Developed as a Halloween-themed project, **SCP: Echoes in the Dark** puts you in the shoes of an SCP field agent, tasked with exploring your surroundings to identify and contain SCP anomalies that manifest in AR.

The project was built using the **8th Wall** AR development platform. Due to workspace access restrictions tied to my university subject, I will no longer be able to make updates or edits once the class concludes. However, this experience allowed me to exceed expectations while creating something truly innovative and spooky.
